 * DESCRIPTION

 *   allocate the page frame with the **smallest pfn**.
 *   You may construct the page table of the @current process. When the page
 *   is allocated with RW_WRITE flag, the page may be later accessed for writes.
 *   However, the pages populated with RW_READ only should not be accessed with
 *   RW_WRITE accesses.
 *
 * RETURN
 *   Return allocated page frame number.
 *   Return -1 if all page frames are allocated.

 * DESCRIPTION

 *
 *   If there is no process with @pid in the @processes list, fork a process
 *   from the @current. This implies the forked child process should have
 *   the identical page table entry 'values' to its parent's (i.e., @current)
 *   page table. 
 *   To implement the copy-on-write feature, you should manipulate the writable
 *   bit in PTE and mapcounts for shared pages. You can use pte->private to
 *   remember whether the PTE was originally writable or not.
